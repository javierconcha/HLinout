$a_{YS}$ cannot be determined directly. An approximation of $a_{YS}$ may be obtained by a spectrophotometer scan of a filtered sample (\citet{Bukata1995}, p.125). Spectrophotometer used in normal mode do not measure true absorbance but {\color{red} attenuance} because all the scattered light is measured. To overcome this, the cells can be placed close to a wide photomultiplier (\citet{Kirk1983}, p.51).

\section{Remote-Sensing Reflectance Measurement}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This section describes how to take the remote-sensing measurement using a single instrument that measures radiance (spectroradiometer or spectrometer) such as an SVC or ASD instrument. This procedure is taken from \cite{Mobley:1999} and \cite{Mueller1995}. 

The remote-sensing reflectance $R_{rs}$ is defined as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Rrs}
	R_{rs}(\theta,\phi,\lambda)=\frac{L_w(\theta,\phi,\lambda)}{E_d(\lambda)}
\end{equation}
where $L_w$ is the water-leaving radiance in the polar and azimuthal directions $\theta$ and $\phi$, respectively, and $E_d$ is the downwelling spectral plane irradiance incident onto the water surface. A radiometer pointing down toward the water surface in direction $(\pi-\theta,\phi)$ does not directly measure $L_w$. Instead, it measures $L_w$  plus any incident sky radiance reflected $L_r$ by the water surface into the field of view of the sensor. This total radiance at the sensor $L_t$ is define as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lt}
	L_t(\theta,\phi) = L_r(\theta,\phi)+L_w(\theta,\phi)\Rightarrow L_w(\theta,\phi)=L_t(\theta,\phi) - L_r(\theta,\phi)
\end{equation}

The term $L_r$ can be replaced by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lsky}
	L_r = \rho L_{sky}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the proportionality factor that relates the radiance measured when the sensor views the sky to the reflected sky radiance measured when the sensor views the water surface. \cite{Mobley:1999} suggests to use $\rho \approx 0.028$ for a sensor view angle $\theta_v \approx 40^\circ$ from the nadir and  $\phi_v \approx 135^\circ$ from the Sun with the constraints of a clear sky and wind speed less than $5m/s$.

Although $E_d$ could be measured directly with an appropriate sensor, it will be estimated from the radiance measured from a Lambertian surface (Spectralon) because both instruments in this case (SVC and ASD) are set to measure radiance. When an irradiance $E_d$ falls in a Lambertian surface with a known irradiance reflectance $R_g$, the uniform radiance $L_g$ leaving the surface is given by 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lg}
	L_g = (R_g/\pi)E_d\Rightarrow E_d = L_g*\pi/R_g
\end{equation}

Applying \autoref{eq:Lt} ,\autoref{eq:Lsky} and \autoref{eq:Lg} in \autoref{eq:Rrs} yields

\begin{equation}
	R_{rs} = \frac{L_t-\rho L_{sky}}{\frac{\displaystyle \pi}{\displaystyle R_g}L_g}
\end{equation}

\subsection{ASD}

The ASD should be in ``radiance mode''. Three different radiance measurements need to be taken:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $L_g$: pointing the Spectralon

Description: $L_g$ is measured with the sensor pointing downward in the same direction as is used in viewing the water surface (see \autoref{fig:Ltmea}), while the Spectralon is inserted into the sensor FOV. The Spectralon should be normal to the water surface.

	\item $L_t$: pointing the water surface

Description: $L_t$ is measured with the sensor pointing downward toward the water surface in the direction $\approx \pi-\theta_v = 140^\circ$ from nadir with $\theta_v = 40^\circ$ and $\phi_v \approx 135^\circ$ or $\phi_v \approx -135^\circ$ from the Sun as illustrated in \autoref{fig:Ltmea}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{./Images/Lgmea.png}
    \vspace{0.5cm}
   \caption[]{\label{fig:Ltmea} $L_t$ measurement.}
\end{figure}

	\item $L_{sky}$: pointing the sky

Description: $L_{sky}$ is measured with the sensor pointing upward toward the sky in the direction $\approx \theta_v = 40^\circ$ from nadir and $\phi_v \approx 135^\circ$ or $\phi_v \approx -135^\circ$ from the Sun as illustrated in \autoref{fig:Lskymea}.

    \vspace{0.5cm}
   \caption[]{\label{fig:Lskymea} $L_{sky}$ measurement.}
\end{figure}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{SVC}
The same three radiance measurements described above need to be taken:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $L_g$: pointing the Spectralon

Description: The measurement is taken in the same fashion described in the previous section and it is taken only once per site. When the SVC instrument is used in ``reflectance mode'', it is necessary to measure first an standard measurement (Spectralon measurement). This standard measurement is the $L_r$ and is recorded internally in the ``sig'' file. Therefore, $L_r$ needs to be extracted from the later from the ``sig'' file. 

	\item $L_t$: pointing the water surface

Description: $L_t$ is measured in the same fashion described in the previous section. However, this measurement is saved internally in the ``sig'' file after the standard measurement column ($L_g$).

	\item $L_{sky}$: pointing the sky	

Description: $L_{sky}$ is measured in the same fashion described in the previous section. However, this measurement is saved internally in the ``sig'' file after the standard measurement column ($L_g$).

\end{itemize}
{\bf Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wear dark clothes, preferable black.
	\item Avoid any reflection from nearby objects in the boat or ship.

  \item Rinse cell with purified water
  \item Clean and dry the external surface of the cells with optics paper. Be careful with scratching the surface, specially the front and bottom faces
  \item Select a Slit Width equal to $5.0~[nm]$ in the photometer software
  \item Select a Sampling Interval of $1~[nm]$ or $2~[nm]$ in the photometer software
  \item Fill both cells with purified water and extract bubbles
