\begin{abstract}

New approaches need to be considered to solve the current high demand for color producing agents (CPAs) retrieval over inland and coastal water (Case 2 waters). 
%
Standard retrieval algorithms are known to fail over high turbid Case 2 waters because they were developed specifically for open ocean (Case 1 waters). 
%
Landsat 8 provides an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a new spectral coastal band in the blue. 
%
This additional information enables a mean to tackle this retrieval endeavor. 
%Methods
We implemented a look-up-table (LUT) and spectrum-matching methodology to simultaneously retrieve CPAs, taking advantage of these Landsat 8's new features. 
%
We created a LUT of spectral remote-sensing reflectances ($R_{rs}$) with different concentration of CPAs using the in-water radiative transfer model Hydrolight. 
%
We developed a model-based empirical line method (MoB-ELM) algorithm to atmospherically correct the Landsat 8 imagery and allow direct comparison with the LUTs of $R_{rs}$. 
%
This  MoB-ELM atmospheric correction algorithm uses pseudo-invariant features (PIF) from the image, ground-truth data and the Hydrolight model.
%Results
The retrieval algorithm shows an error of less than X\% for each of the CPAs when compared with ground-truth data. 
%Conclusions

These results demonstrate that the developed algorithm allows the mapping of concentration of CPAs in Case 2 waters over areas where the standard algorithms are no available due to spatial resolution specifications\todo{check this statement}.
%
Therefore, this study shows that Landsat 8 satellite can be utilized over Case 2 water studies as long as a careful atmospheric correction is applied.

\section{Introduction}
The launching of new generation high spatial satellites (e.g. Landsat 8, Sentinel 2) is opening a complete new era in the remote sensing of coastal and inland waters. New sensor specifications, such as higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and higher spatial resolution, could meet the requirements needed to have available the same kinds of tools (e.g. Chl-{\it a} product) that the first generation of ocean color satellites (e.g. MODIS, SeaWiFS) made available for open ocean more than a decade and half ago. The hope is to have these tools for coastal and inland waters available at a global scale and in a regular basis, similar to MODIS capabilities for open ocean, for instance. Although Landsat 8 does not have a daily frequency as MODIS, its 16-day frequency makes it a good candidate to accomplish this endeavor, and most importantly, prepare the way for future missions with similar spatial resolution specifications (e.g. Sentinel 2, PACE, HyspIRI, GEO-CAPE).

% Atmospheric correction over Case 2 water
The retrieval of color producing agents (CPA) (chlorophyll-{\it a}, sediments (or total suspended solid (TSS)) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)) is in general performed in the reflectance domain, so the very first step is to perform a high quality atmospheric correction to convert the radiance image from the satellite to reflectance units. To perform an accurate atmospheric correction over water is extremely complex since the most of the signal reaching the sensor is due to atmospheric scattering, some to the surface reflected signal, and only a small fraction of it is due to the signal of interest, the water-leaving signal. Therefore, it is important to perform a rigorous atmospheric compensation. 

The most of the atmospheric correction algorithms for open ocean (Case 2 waters) are based in the methods developed for ocean color satellites by \cite{Gordon:1997}. These methods are based on the fact that the signal leaving the water does not contribute to the overall signal beyond the NIR part of the spectrum of light, so the signal reaching the sensor is caused only by atmospheric scattering (\cite{Gordon:1994}). This is known as the {\it black pixel assumption}. This concept can be expanded to the SWIR bands when the black pixel assumption is not valid in the NIR bands, which is the case for Case 2 and high productive Case 1 waters (\cite{Wang:2007}). Unfortunately, most of these methods are not suitable for highly turbid coastal water, although different modifications to these algorithms have been suggested (\cite{Patt2003}).
% Landsat 8
The Landsat project has been monitoring the earth for more than four decades, being the longest uninterrupted data set available. The Landsat satellites' main mission is to image the land areas of the earth and therefore there are typically no open ocean (case 1 water) images available. This is one of the reasons why Landsat satellites have been underestimated by the ocean color community for the study of water bodies. In addition, the Landsat instruments have generally had broad bands and low SNR when compared to ocean color satellites such as SeaWiFS and MODIS\todo{add citation for MODIS,SeaWiFS}. However, Landsat 8 could fulfill a niche in the ocean color community for coastal and inland water body studies where a $1000m$ spatial resolution is not suitable. This is where Landsat 8 has a valuable potential for water quality studies in more optically complex water bodies (Case 2 or high productive Case 1 waters). 

Landsat 8 is the new generation of Landsat satellites with two state-of-the-art instruments onboard, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal InfraRed Scanner (TIRS) (\cite{Irons:2012}). With its 12-bit quantization and improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), OLI is a big improvement to the Landsat mission. In addition, OLI includes a new coastal band that increased the spectral resolution of the instrument. These improvements are the main drivers to hypothesize that the Landsat 8 satellite could definitely have a better performance in water quality studies than its predecessors. \cite{Roy:2014} stated this potential use of Landsat 8 for fresh and coastal water studies, mainly due to a reported signal-to-noise ratio that exceeded expectations and the new coastal band.\todo{develop more} 

\cite*{Gerace:2013} demonstrated that the spectral coverage and radiometric resolution of OLI dramatically improve our ability to simultaneously retrieve the CPAs concentrations from water bodies. \cite{Vanhellemont2014} and \cite{Vanhellemont:2015} created a tool to apply the standard algorithm for atmospheric correction over water developed by \cite{Gordon:1994} to Landsat 8 over turbid and extremely turbid waters. In \cite{Vanhellemont:2015}, after atmospheric correction, they used the end product for detection of high concentrations of black sediments, but concentration values were not reported\todo{develop more}. \cite{Franz:2015} describes an implementation of the atmospheric corrections developed by \cite{Gordon:1994} applied to Landsat 8 in the SeaDAS software package\todo{develop more and add reference}~ and comparison with results from MODIS are shown.

% Standard retrieval algorithms
The standard algorithms used for chlorophyll retrieval use the methods described by \cite{OReilly2000}. Also, neural network (NN) approach \cite{Kallio:2015} that simultaneously retrieves all CPAs.\todo{develop more}

We developed a process to retrieve CPAs from Landsat 8 imagery over Case 2 waters, which includes inland and coastal water. The retrieval algorithm compares water remote-sensing reflectance ($R_{rs}$) spectra with unknown concentrations to $R_{rs}$ spectra in a look-up-table (LUT) whose concentrations are known. The area of study chosen for this work was the Rochester Embayment, Rochester, NY. An example of a Landsat 8 image showing this area of study is illustrated in \autoref{fig:L8Image130919}. This Landsat 8 image was taken on September 19, 2013 (ID: LC80160302013262LGN00). This area includes the Lake Ontario, the Genesee River, Irondequoit Bay and some nearby ponds (Long Pond and Cranberry Pond).

\section{Methods}
% ============================================================
\subsection{Retrieval Process Overview}
The retrieval process described in this work was first introduced by \cite*{Concha2013IGARSS} and based on previous work done by \cite{Raqueno:2000}, \cite{Gerace:2012}, \cite{Pahlevan:2012} and \cite{Gerace:2013}. A flow diagram of the process is illustrated in \autoref{fig:retrieval}. In short, the retrieval process works as follows. First, the radiance image from the satellite is atmospherically corrected and transformed to $R_{rs}$ spectra, as shown in the diagram. At this point the $R_{rs}$ spectra of water pixels in the scene with unknown CPAs concentrations are compared with a LUT of $R_{rs}$ spectra with known CPAs concentrations. This comparison is made by using a spectrum-matching technique (\cite{Raqueno:2000,Mobley:2005}) that calculates the root mean squared error (RMSE) to find the closest match in the LUT. The end product is maps of CPAs concentrations (see \autoref{fig:retrieval}). Each step in this retrieval process is described bellow in more details.

    \caption{Retrieval process flow diagram. The radiance image from the satellite is first corrected for the atmospheric effect, having as result $R_{rs}$ spectra for each water pixel in the image. Then, a spectrum-matching methodology is used to find the closest match in a least-squared sense for the water pixels with unknown CPAs concentration in the LUT of water pixels with known CPAs concentration. The final result is a concentration map for each CPA.  \label{fig:retrieval} }

% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The MoB-ELM Atmospheric Correction}
An overview of the atmospheric correction method used in the work is described by \cite{Concha2014SPIE}, and it is explained in more details in this document. This is a model-based empirical line method (MoB-ELM\todo{does it work?}) based in the work done for simulated OLI data by \cite{Gerace:2012}. The MoB-ELM atmospheric is modified version of the traditional empirical line method (ELM) (a.k.a. empirical line fit or ELF). The ELM atmospheric correction method uses at least two pixels from the scene with known reflectance values \cite{Schott}. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the radiance values from the image and the reflectance values from ground-truth data. Therefore, the ELM method consists in solving the following linear regression:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:ELM} 
	L = m\cdot R_{rs} + b
\end{equation}

\noindent where $L$ is the radiance reaching the sensor value, $m$ is the slope of the regression, $R_{rs}$ is the remote-sensing reflectance of the target, and $b=L_u$ is the intercept, with $L_u$ the upwelled radiance or path radiance. $L$ and $R_{rs}$ in \autoref{eq:ELM} are the known radiance value from the image and the ground-truth data from the field, respectively. In order to solve for the unknown $m$ and $b$ values in \autoref{eq:ELM}, at least two pixels are needed. These two pixels are known as the {\it bright} and {\it dark} pixels because they are chosen from a bright and dark object in the scene in order to be representative of the whole range of values in the scene. The concept behind the traditional ELM is illustrated in \autoref{fig:ELMregression} showing a plot of $R_{rs}$ versus radiance $L$ values for the $ith$ band $Band_{i}$\todo{is it OK to repeat an image?}. This regression is solved for each band independently. After $m$ and $b$ have been determined, the $R_{rs}$ of each water pixel at each wavelength can be calculated from its $L$ value in the image using $R_{rs}=(L-b)/m$. Note that the ELM assumes that the atmosphere is uniform across the complete image.

\end{figure}

The bright and dark object in the scene need to be uniform in at least 3-by-3 pixels (\cite{Schott}). This means that for Landsat 8, these objects have to be at least $90\times 90$ meters. This requirement is not always feasible. Also, it is not always possible to have ground-truth data in every satellite overpass. The MoB-ELM avoids the need for ground-truth collection at each overpass by using a pseudo-invariant features (PIF) in the scene as the bright object and a remote-sensing reflectance value from the physics-based numerical model for water Hydrolight for the dark objects. The following sections describe the way the $L$ and $R_{rs}$ value for these two pixel are determined.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Bright Pixel Determination}

The MoB-ELM method uses a pseudo-invariant features (PIF) extraction to determine the bright pixel from the Landsat 8 image. PIFs are features in the scene that do not change their reflectivity properties drastically over time. Urban features could be considered as PIFs, and therefore, this extraction is applied over an urban area within the image. The downtown of Rochester, NY was selected as the urban area in our case\todo{show Downtown Rochester and the water image!}. We created a PIF mask following the PIF extraction method described by \cite{Schott:1988} in order to isolate the PIF in the Landsat 8 image. A flow diagram describing the PIF extraction method is illustrated in \autoref{fig:PIFflowchart}. This extraction method takes advantage of two facts. The first one is that water is highly absorbent in the short wave infrared. This makes water to be a dark target beyond the infrared wavelengths, i.e. water has low values when compared with urban features and vegetation in the infrared. The second fact is that vegetation has a high value in the infrared when compare with the red (red edge). Therefore, a ratio between the near infrared band and the red band has a high value for vegetation and a low value for urban features and water. 

The steps for the PIF extraction are the following:
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep10pt
	\item A mask that passes the urban features and vegetation, and rejects water is created (represented as Urban ON, Veget. ON and Water OFF in the left arm of \autoref{fig:PIFflowchart}). To accomplish this, the second short wave infrared band (SWIR 2) of Landsat 8 is used. A threshold is selected so that the water pixels are masked off.
	\item A mask that passes the urban features and water, and rejects vegetation is created (represented as Urban ON, Veget. OFF and Water ON in the right arm of \autoref{fig:PIFflowchart}). To accomplish this, the ratio between the NIR band and red band of Landsat 8 is thresholded so that the high values for vegetation are rejected.
	\item The previous two mask are combined using a logic $.AND.$ gate, as shown in \autoref{fig:PIFflowchart}, creating mask that rejects the vegetation and water, and only passes the urban features. This mask is named PIF mask.
	\item The PIF mask is applied to the image, obtaining the PIF image as result.

\end{enumerate}

\caption{Flow chart for the PIF extraction method. Two mask are created. The first one rejects water pixel. The second mask rejects vegetation. The end mask, named PIF mask, is a combination of both previous masks that only passes the urban features. \label{fig:PIFflowchart}}
\end{figure}

Note that the urban features could change from one acquisition time to other, and therefore, the PIF mask should only include the features that are similar over time. Therefore, a total of seven PIF masks from Landsat 8 scenes with clear sky conditions were combined to create a master PIF mask by applying a logic $.AND.$ gate.

The master PIF mask is utilized to determine both the radiance and reflectance value of the bright pixel. The radiance values of the bright pixel are obtained by applying the PIF mask directly to the particular radiance Landsat 8 image. 

The reflectance values of the bright pixel are obtained by applying the master PIF mask to the ``Provisional Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance product'' corresponding the particular Landsat 8 image to be used to perform the retrieval of CPAs. The Provisional Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance product is distributed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and generated from a specialized software called L8SR (more info about this product see \cite{L8SurfProduct2015}). \autoref{fig:PIFmask}\todo{Change mask!}~shows a false color image (R: NIR, G: Red B: Green) of Downtown Rochester, NY (a) and the master PIF mask applied to the this image (b). Note that only the urban features are shown in (b), and the rest of the pixels are masked off (black pixels).

Once the master PIF mask is applied to the Provisional Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance product for the particular Landsat 8 image, the statistic are calculated including all of the PIF pixels and the mean value for each band is used as the reflectance values of the bright pixels. Finally, the reflectance values are divided by $\pi$ in order to have the same units as $R_{rs}$. \autoref{fig:MOBELMpxls} shows an example of radiance value (a) and the $R_{rs}$ value (b) for the bright pixel (solid line) in a Landsat 8 scene.

\subsubsection{Black Pixel Determination}
\label{subsubsec:blackpixel}

The $R_{rs}$\todo{define $R_{rs}$} spectra for the dark pixel is obtained from the Ecolight model, which is a special version of the Hydrolight model that runs faster. The Hydrolight model is a radiative transfer numerical model that computes radiance distribution and derived quantities (e.g. $R_{rs}$) for natural water bodies (\cite{MobleyHE}). The angle of interest for this work is only the nadir angle, and therefore, Ecolight is a more convenient option. It is suggested to use the Ecolight model when only the nadir-viewing $R_{rs}$ is needed since the Ecolight model only solves the azimuthal averaged version of the radiative transfer equation (RTE). Solving only the azimuthal average version of the RTE requires much less computer time than solving the RTE for all azimuthal directions to have the full radiance distribution as in Hydrolight (\cite{MobleyHE}). Note that Ecolight used exactly the same inputs as Hydrolight.

The dark pixel is taken from a ROI over water present in the Landsat 8 radiance image with low concentration of CPAs. Inherent optical properties (IOPs) and CPAs concentrations measurements taken in the field from the same ROI are input to Ecolight. The field and lab measurements are described in Section \ref{subsec:FieldLabMea} below. The ``Case 2 model'' in Ecolight is used to generate a $R_{rs}$ spectra for the dark pixel to be used in the MoB-ELM method. This Case 2 model is a generic four-component (pure water, chlorophyll-bearing particles, CDOM, and mineral particles) IOP model (\cite{MobleyHEtech}). Concentration, phase function, and mass-specific absorption and scattering coefficient spectra for each CPA need to be input separately in the Case 2 model of Ecolight. 

An example of the inputs used to generate the $R_{rs}$ spectra of the dark pixel for a particular date is specified below. \autoref{tab:ONTNSconc} shows the CPAs concentrations for two different water samples from the stations of the data collection on September, 19th, 2013. The location of these stations is shown in \autoref{fig:0910913Sites}. These water samples were collected from the nearshore of Lake Ontario (labeled as ONTNS) and from the southern part of Long Pond (labeled as LONGS), and they represent two scenarios with totally different concentration of CPAs. The concentration of CPAs are chlorophyll-{\it a} concentration $X_{Chl-{\it a}}$, total suspended solids concentration $X_{TSS}$ and CDOM absorption coefficient at $\lambda_0=440nm$ $a_{CDOM}(\lambda_0=440nm)$. The water sample ONTNS was used to generate the reflectance spectra for the dark pixel in Ecolight since it exhibits low concentration of CPAs. The concentrations for each component were set to be constant with depth in Ecolight with the values shown in \autoref{tab:ONTNSconc} since we are only interested in the water-leaving signal.

The absorption properties for the component chlorophyll-{\it a} were input by user-supplied data files containing mass-specific absorption coefficients as a function of wavelength. This mass-specific absorption spectra is shown in \autoref{fig:CHLcoef}.(a)\todo{typo in a* units!}. This data was obtained from lab measurements of absorption coefficient spectra for the water sample ONTNS with a spectrophotometric method following SeaWiFS protocols (\cite{Mueller1995})\todo{check!}. The spectrophotometric method yields absorption coefficients, which are converted to mass-specific absorption coefficients by dividing the absorption coefficients spectra by its concentration ($X_{Chl-{\it a}}$). This chlorophyll concentration was determined in lab by a {\todo{describe method} spectrophotometric method} as well. For the chlorophyll-{\it a} scattering properties, the same mass-specific scattering coefficient data used in \cite{Raqueno:2000} and \cite{Raqueno:2003} were utilized. This data was characterized through laboratory studies as part of a data collection on May 20, 1999 over the same area of study for the AVIRIS and MISI sensors. This data is shown in \autoref{fig:CHLcoef}.(b). A Fournier-Forand (FF) phase function with backscatter fraction 0.010 was selected as the scattering phase function for the chlorophyll-{\it a}. The details about the selection of this specific phase function will be described below.

For the CDOM component, the absorption specification $a_{CDOM}(\lambda)$ was input following the format required by Ecolight. First, the absorption coefficients were determined by spectrophotometric measurements in lab for the ONTNS water sample. This data is shown in \autoref{fig:CDOMcoef}.(a). Then, the data were normalized by the absorption value $a(\lambda_0)=0.1151[1/m]$ at the reference wavelength $\lambda_0=440nm$, so that $a^*(\lambda_0)=1$. This normalized data is shown in \autoref{fig:CDOMcoef}.(b) as purple dots. An exponential curve with the following equation

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:CDOMabs}
	a^*(\lambda)=a^*(\lambda_0)\exp{\left[-\gamma(\lambda-\lambda_0)\right]}
\end{equation}

\noindent was fitted to the normalized data. It was determined that the decay constant $\gamma=0.0126$. The fitted curve is illustrated in \autoref{fig:CDOMcoef}.(b) in solid line. The parameters of this fitted curve are input in Ecolight to specify the CDOM normalized mass-specific absorption $a^*$, and $a(\lambda_0)=0.1151[1/m]$ to specify the the CDOM absorption coefficient at the reference wavelength $\lambda_0=440nm$.

The mineral mass-specific absorption coefficient was determined in the same fashion as for the chlorophyll mass-specific absorption coefficient from lab measurements of the ONTNS water sample. The mineral mass-specific absorption coefficient are shown in \autoref{fig:SMcoef}.(a). The mineral mass-specific scattering coefficient was the same used by \cite{Raqueno:2000} and \cite{Raqueno:2003} and are shown in \autoref{fig:SMcoef}.(b). A Fournier-Forand (FF) phase function with backscatter fraction 0.010 was selected as the scattering phase function for the minerals.

The following parameters were input to Ecolight in order to simulate the Landsat 8 acquisition conditions. The illumination conditions were input to Ecolight by specifying the solar zenith angle and day of the year that matched the Landsat 8 image. Internal sources and inelastic scatter were not included in the simulations. The wavelength range was $[400nm,1000nm]$, with a $1nm$ step. Default values for the air-water surface conditions were used, with a windspeed equal to $5m/s$, a real index of refraction equal to $n=1.34$, and the semi-empirical sky model (based on RADTRAN-X). Recall that Hydrolight uses a Cox-Munk air-water surface model that parameterizes gravity and capillary waves via the wind speed \todo{reference to Cox-Munk}. Finally, the bottom boundary condition used in Ecolight was ``the water column is infinitely deep.''

\todo{update with new Rrs measurement}One of the input parameters needed by Ecolight is the scattering phase function for each component. Ecolight generates a Fournier-Forand phase function for a given backscatter fraction $b_b/b$. $b_b/b$ could have values between $0.0001$ and $0.50$ (i.e. [$0.01\%$-$50\%$]). There were no available information about $b_b/b$ from measurements, and the following approach was used to determine the scattering phase function for both the chlorophyll-{\it a} and the mineral particles components. A LUT of $R_{rs}$ with different scattering phase function was created in the following fashion. One Ecolight run was obtained for each discretized Fournier-Forand phase functions from the library of phase functions supplied with Ecolight 5.2, but maintaining the rest of the input parameters to Ecolight the same, i.e. concentrations, IOPs, surface and bottom boundary conditions, atmospheric conditions, and geometry. These parameters correspond to the ONTNS water sample. The different $R_{rs}$ spectra in the LUT were compared with the $R_{rs}$ for ONTNS measured in situ. The best match was determining by choosing the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) between the $R_{rs}$ for ONTNS water sample measured in situ and the simulated $R_{rs}$ spectra for ONTNS water sample.

It was determined that the best match corresponds to the discretized Fournier-Forand phase function with a backscatter equal to $0.010$, i.e. $1\%$ of backscatter fraction (file name: FFbb010.dpf). Therefore, this discretized Fournier-Forand phase function with $1\%$ of backscatter fraction was used for both the chlorophyll-{\it a} and mineral particles. \autoref{fig:BestMatchONTNS}\todo{update figure with $R_{rs}$ instead of reflectance!}~ illustrates the $R_{rs}$ measured in situ (red solid line) and the best match $R_{rs}$ from the LUT (blue solid line), generated with a discretized Fournier-Forand phase function of 0.010 backscatter fraction. {It can be seen in \autoref{fig:BestMatchONTNS} that both spectra agree in values above $550nm$, but not below this wavelength. This suggests that there is still need for improvement in the determination of the phase function and rest of the parameters in the Ecolight model, or there is a problem in the field measurements\todo{Should I mention this?}}. This best matched from the LUT of $R_{rs}$ with different phase functions was used as the $R_{rs}$ spectra of the dark pixel in the MoB-ELM method. This $R_{rs}$ is further spectrally sampled to the Landsat 8 spectral response. \autoref{fig:MOBELMpxls}.(b)\todo{change ONTOS to ONTNS in fig.}~ shows this $R_{rs}$ spectra as a black dashed line.

\end{figure}

The radiance spectra for the dark pixel is obtained from a ROI in the Landsat 8 radiance image that includes the ONTNS station. Statistics are computed in this dark region, and the mean values in each band is used as radiance spectra for the dark pixel. This radiance spectra for the dark pixel is shown in \autoref{fig:MOBELMpxls}.(a) as black dashed line.

As a review, \autoref{fig:MOBELMpxls} shows the different spectra used to perform the MoB-ELM atmospheric correction method, where four different spectra can be seen: one $R_{rs}$ and one radiance spectra for the bright pixel (obtained using the PIF extraction over the Provisional Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance product and Landsat 8 image, respectively), one $R_{rs}$ spectra for the dark pixel (obtained from HydroLight), and one radiance spectra for bright pixel (obtained from the statistics of a ROI over water in the Landsat 8 image). These spectra are used by the MoB-ELM to atmospherically correct the Landsat 8 image using the ENVI Classic software \cite{ENVIUserGuide}. This is performed using the ``Empirical Line'' algorithm of the ``Calibration Utilities'' in ENVI classic, where the Landsat 8 image is used as the input image, and the $R_{rs}$ spectra are labeled as ``field spectra'' and the radiance spectra are labeled as ``data spectra.'' The final product of this process is an image in $R_{rs}$ values for each water pixel, which will be used to perform the retrieval of CPAs concentrations described in Section \ref{subsec:Retrieval} below. As an example of the MoB-ELM product, \autoref{fig:RrsROIs140929} shows the $R_{rs}$ spectra for the different stations of the 09-29-14 collection\todo{change reflectance for 09-19-13}~ shown in \autoref{fig:0910913Sites}.

\subsection{LUT Generation}


A LUT of $R_{rs}$ is generated in Ecolight for different combinations of CPAs concentrations and scattering phase functions. \autoref{tab:LUTconc2} shows the different parameters used to create the LUT in Ecolight. Ecolight was used in the same fashion as in the black pixel determination for the MoB-ELM (Section \ref{subsubsec:blackpixel}). Two different sets of IOPs (mass-specific absorption and scattering spectra) were used, one set for modeling the open lake conditions (low concentration of CPAs) from the lab measurements for the ONTNS site, and one set for modeling the ponds condition (high concentration of CPAs) from the lab measurements for the LONGS site\todo{show IOPs figures}. These IOPs are labeled in \autoref{tab:LUTconc2} as ``ONTNS'' for the open lake conditions and as ``LONGS'' for the ponds conditions. \autoref{tab:LUTconc2} also shows the CPAs concentration used to create the LUT in Ecolight. Furthermore, for different discretized Fournier-Forand phase functions with four different $b_b/b$ values (i.e. $0.5$, $1.0$, $1.5$ and $2.0\%$) were used for the Chlorophyll-{\it} and mineral particles scattering phase functions.

After obtaining the LUT of $R_{rs}$ from Ecolight, the spectral curves in the LUT are spectrally sampled to the OLI's spectral response. A set of $2000$ $R_{rs}$ spectra is shown in {\todo{change for $R_{rs}$} \autoref{fig:LUT}} as an example of a LUT created in Ecolight.

\subsection{Retrieval Algorithm} 
\label{subsec:Retrieval}
The retrieval of CPAs concentrations is based in the work done by \cite*{Gerace:2013}. A spectral-matching technique was applied with the purpose of finding the closest match to a given water $R_{rs}$ spectra within the LUT of $R_{rs}$ from Ecolight. In this work spectral matching technique was perform using the root mean squared error (RMSE), which is defined as

\begin{equation}
  RMSE(i) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^M\left[\widetilde{R}_{rs}(i,\lambda_m)-R_{rs}(\lambda_m)\right]^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\widetilde{R}_{rs}(i,\lambda_m)$ is the $i$th $R_{rs}$ spectrum from the LUT at wavelength band $m$ and $R_{rs}(\lambda_m)$ is the water $R_{rs}$ spectrum at wavelength band $m$ from the atmospherically corrected Landsat 8 image. For each water pixel in the atmospherically corrected Landsat 8 image, the RMSE value is calculated with every $i$th element in the LUT. Then, the element of the LUT that results in the smallest RMSE value is chosen as the CPAs concentrations for that particular water pixel. This method gives discretized values for the concentrations equal to the values used to create the LUT. The output of this process is a concentration mapping for each CPA.

\subsection{Ground Truth Data Collection and Lab Measurements}
\label{subsec:FieldLabMea}

% The area of study for this research is the Lake Ontario Rochester Embayment (latitude: 43°15'32.53"N and longitude: 77°36'13.10"W), which includes some nearby ponds (Long and Cranberry Ponds), the Genesee River plume, the Irondequoit Bay and the southern end of Lake Ontario, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:areaofstudy1} and Figure~\ref{fig:areaofstudy2}. This area was selected because it exhibits a wide range of variability in concentration of water constituents, so the retrieval algorithm can be tested with different scenarios. Landsat 8 images from this area of study and corresponding water samples collected at the time of the satellite's overpass will be used to test the retrieval algorithm. So far, there are only three satisfactory images available from the summer 2013. This project contemplates performing one new ground truth data collection during 2014. Therefore, images from the 2013-2014 spring and summer collection seasons will be used to test the methodology. Note that a difficult challenge of this research is to obtain images with relatively clear weather conditions (i.e. cloud free) over the area of study.

% The first area of study used in this research is the Rochester Embayment in the city of Rochester, NY. This area of study includes some nearby ponds (Long and Cranberry ponds), the Genesee River plume, the Irondequoit bay and part of Lake Ontario. This area was selected because it exhibits a wide range of variability in concentration of water constituents, so the retrieval algorithm can be tested with different scenarios. \autoref{fig:0910913Sites} shows an image over this area of study for the data collection done on September, $19^{th}$, 2013  with the different sites as an example. The data collections are divided in two crews. One crew, named ``Lake crew'', is in charge of the Irondequoit Bay, Ontario near shore, Ontario off shore, Genesee River plume, Genesee River pier sites (labeled in \autoref{fig:0910913Sites} as IBayN, OntNS, OntOS, RvrPLM and RvrPIER, respectively). The other crew, named ``Ponds crew'', is in charge of the Long Pond north and south, Cranberry Pond sites (labeled in \autoref{fig:0910913Sites} as LongN, LongS and Cranb, respectively).

% Water samples are collected for each site in dark Nalgene bottles. Additionally, remote-sensing reflectances are measured using an ASD and a SVC instrument (one for each crew). Backscattering measurements are taken using a HydroScat-2. This measurement is taken by both crew only if the logistic of the particular day allows it. Otherwise priority is given to the Lake crew. For each site, a location is recorded using a GPS. \autoref{tab:collect} shows a summary of the data collections done in 2013 and 2014 seasons with the respective available data.

% In order to have outputs in HydroLight that are representative of the water bodies that are being studied, inherent optical properties (IOPs) of those specific waters have to be defined as input to the HydroLight model. After collection, these water samples need to be analyzed in the lab to obtain IOPs for the main water constituents. Furthermore, apparent optical properties (AOPs) (i.e. water surface reflectance) and backscattering measurements will be also collected for further comparison and to pursue closure between the HydroLight AOPs results and in-situ AOPs measurements.

% After collection, the water samples are analyzed in laboratory. These lab measurements include concentration of CHL and TSS, absorption coefficients of CHL, TSS and CDOM. The Chlorophyll-{\it a} concentration measurements needed to be validated with measurements analyzed by a credible lab (Monroe County Environmental Laboratory). This comparison with this lab shows agreement between the measurements. \autoref{tab:collect} shows the measurements available. \todo{include references to procedures}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SECTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}

% The results from the retrieval process are validated by comparison with measurements taken from the water bodies being studied. Before this process, the measurements needed to be validated with measurements analyzed by a credible lab (Monroe County Environmental Laboratory). This comparison with this lab shows agreement between the measurements. 

% The area of study is the Lake Ontario Rochester Embayment that includes some nearby ponds (Long and Cranberry ponds), the Genesee River plume, the Irondequoit bay and part of Lake Ontario. This area was selected because it exhibits a wide range of variability in concentration of water constituents, so the retrieval algorithm can be tested against a wide range of water conditions.


% Preliminary results for concentration maps for each CPA over the Rochester Embayment, Rochester, NY are shown in \autoref{fig:CPAsMaps}  The expected trend of having low concentration of CPAs in the offshore of Lake Ontario and higher concentrations in the nearby ponds (Long Pond and Cranberry Pond) can be seen. 

% Comparisons between retrieved CPAs concentrations and field measurements are shown in \autoref{fig:CPAsMaps} for four different stations in the area of study. This comparison with field measurements showed good agreement at low concentrations but differences at higher concentrations. Ongoing work is focusing on incorporation of the IOP differences between water bodies in the LUT optimization process.
